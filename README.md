This repo contains a solver for the IQ twist puzzle game [1]. It uses an implementation of the dancing links algorithm [here](https://github.com/Logismos/dlx). The solver compiles to webassembly, and a very simple front-end has been made for generating and visualizing solutions.

See live demo (TODO).

When cloning, don't forget to add the recursive option to capture the submodule:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Logismos/iq-twist.git
```
